// Microservices:

// 1. Single Responsibility: Each service has only one Responsibility.
// 2. Independence: Each service is developed, deployed and scaled Independently.
// 3.Communication: Services can Communicate through APIs: (Rest, gRPC or minimal APIs) or brokers like (RabbitMQ or Kafka)
// 4. Loose Coupling: Microservices should be loosely coupled, meaning changes to one service should not impact others as long as the contracts between them remain the same.
// 5. Scalability: can scale independently. If one part goes down, others will remain working.

// Advantages of Microservices:

// --> Independent development
// --> Independent deployment
// --> Scalability
// --> Resilience 
// --> Tech Stack Flexibility

// Challenges Of Microservices:

// --> Complexity in maintaining codebase.
// --> Data Consistency
// --> Testing
// --> Monitoring
